<h1 class="title">12 Volt Conversions for Classic Chevy and GMC Trucks</h1>
<h2 class="subtitle"></h2>
<div style="margin-top: 24px;">
    <p>A conversion from 6 to 12 volts is one of the simplest and most rewarding upgrades you can give your classic truck. A modern 12v electrical system will give you easier starting, brighter headlights, and compatibility with other components like power accessories or stereo equipment. The conversion can be done in a few hours and the required parts are relatively inexpensive. These instructions apply specifically to the 1947 &#8211; 1954 Advance Design Chevy and GMC trucks, but the procedure outlined here can also be applied to other makes and models.</p>
    <h2>Conversion Options</h2>
    <p>The conversion can be done using either a 12v generator, or a 12v alternator:</p>
    <p>A 12v generator will look original, and can be mounted on a Chevy 6 with some very minor alterations to the brackets. You can find a replacement 12v generator, or have field coils replaced in the existing 6v generator case. Mid 50s Chevy cars came from the factory with 12 volt generators mounted on a 235, and make great replacements. The disadvantages of using a generator are minor and are not usually an issue. Any generator system will show a slight discharge at idle, and most alternators are capable of delivering more amps than a generator system.</p>
    <p>A seemingly more widely used approach is to replace the generator with a modern alternator with an internal regulator. An alternator will generally provide more power with less maintenance than a generator, but some originality must be sacrificed.</p>
    <h2>Before we begin</h2>
    <p>Before we dig in to the conversion, lets establish a few facts:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Your original 6V wiring harness will work! A 6V electrical system carries twice the amps of a 12V system, so your existing wiring is actually heavier than necessary.</li>
        <li>You can use your original 6V starter. It works great!</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Switch your GMC to Negative Ground</h2>
    <p>While you&#8217;re at it, this is a great time to convert your GMC with POS ground to NEG ground. (Chevrolet trucks are already negative ground) This switch can be done in a few simple steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Disconnect the battery.</li>
        <li>Reverse the wires on the Ammeter. &#8220;In&#8221; becomes &#8220;Out&#8221; and vice-versa.</li>
        <li>Reverse the wires on the coil. Ignition is now (+)</li>
        <li>Reconnect the battery cables in reverse. POS will now go to the starter. NEG will be attached to the ground strap.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Make a Parts List</h2>
    <p>The following items will be required, regardless of which conversion method you use. <a href="http://www.patricksantiquecars.com/" target="_blank">Patrick&#8217;s Antique Cars</a>has all the parts you&#8217;ll need for the conversion, but you can also find them from other vendors or your local auto parts store.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>12-Volt Battery. (Find one that fits your battery box)</li>
        <li>12-Volt Coil with Built-in Ballast Resistor.</li>
        <li>12-Volt Light Bulbs (Headlights, turn signals, brake, dash, interior, park lights, etc.)</li>
        <li>12-Volt Flasher(s) and Relay(s) (if required)</li>
        <li>Gas Gauge Voltage Reducer. (Available from <a href="http://www.classicparts.com/1947-54-Gas-Gauge-Voltage-Reducer/productinfo/24-995/" target="_blank">Classic Parts</a> or <a href="http://www.patricksantiquecars.com/" target="_blank">Patrick&#8217;s Antique Cars</a>.)</li>
        <li>Accessory Voltage Reducer for the Heater. (Available from <a href="http://www.classicparts.com/1947-54-Accessory-Voltage-Reducer/productinfo/24-996/" target="_blank">Classic Parts</a> or <a href="http://www.patricksantiquecars.com/" target="_blank">Patrick&#8217;s Antique Cars</a>.)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Some accessories, such as power solenoids and radios must be replaced or converted to 12 volts. A simple resistor will not work. If your vehicle has an ammeter, it will work properly on 6 or 12 volts without any modifications.</p>
    <h2>The Conversion with a 12 Volt Generator</h2>
    <p>A 12-volt conversion using a generator is quite simple. (All parts are available from <a href="http://www.patricksantiquecars.com/" target="_blank">Patrick&#8217;s Antique Cars</a>)</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Disconnect the battery.</li>
        <li>Remove the 6V generator and install the 12V generator in the same way.</li>
        <li>Replace the 6V Voltage Regulator with a 12V regulator.</li>
        <li>Replace the 6V Coil with a 12V Coil. Use a coil with an internal resistor or install an ignition ballast resistor in the wire between the coil and the ignition switch.</li>
        <li>Replace all light bulbs. Don&#8217;t forget dash/instrument lights and turn signal indicators.</li>
        <li>Replace all flashers and relays.</li>
        <li>Install the above listed Gas Gauge Voltage Reducer on the rear of the gauge.</li>
        <li>Install the above listed Accessory Voltage Reducer in the wire between the heater and heater switch.</li>
        <li>Make sure all other accessories are 12-volt ready.</li>
        <li>Reconnect the Battery and you&#8217;re done!</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>The Conversion with an Alternator</h2>
    <p>An alternator conversion is slightly more complicated than generator conversion, but it&#8217;s still pretty straightforward. (Again, all parts are available from <a href="http://www.patricksantiquecars.com/" target="_blank">Patrick&#8217;s Antique Cars</a>)</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Disconnect the battery.</li>
        <li>Remove the 6V generator.</li>
        <li>Mount the Alternator. Brackets are available from various manufacturers.</li>
        <li>Use a &#8220;DA Plug&#8221; which allows you to eliminate the old voltage regulator. Attach the short wire to the alternator post. Attach the long DA wire to the ignition switch so it is powered only when the switch is on.</li>
        <li>Remove the voltage regulator, and connect the BATT wire to the wire that previously ran to the generator. Attach this to the alternator post (along with the short DA wire).</li>
        <li>Replace the 6V Coil with a 12V Coil. Use a coil with an internal resistor or install an ignition ballast resistor in the wire between the coil and the ignition switch.</li>
        <li>Replace all light bulbs. Don&#8217;t forget dash/instrument lights and turn signal indicators.</li>
        <li>Replace all flashers and relays.</li>
        <li>Install the above listed Gas Gauge Voltage Reducer on the rear of the gauge.</li>
        <li>Install the above listed Accessory Voltage Reducer in the wire between the heater and heater switch.</li>
        <li>Make sure all other accessories are 12-volt ready.</li>
        <li>Reconnect the Battery and you&#8217;re done!</li>
    </ol>



    Tired of Dim Headlights?

    Ever wanted to convert to 12 volts, but didn't want to sacrifice your original engine compartment? Well, here's a few tricks to help you solve your problem while staying original at the same time. Thanks to Patrick's Antique Cars and Trucks for information quoted from their catalog.

    Wait! I have a positive-ground GMC, what do I do?

    This so easy, you'll kick yourself for not having figured it out on your own. All you have to do to convert that Jimmy to negative ground is:

    Disconnect the battery (VERY important first step)
    Reverse the wires on the coil
    Reverse the wires on the ammeter
    Reverse the battery cables. While you're at it, why not switch the ground cable from going to the frame to a starter mounting bolt or the transmission? It's better than the frame.
    Put all your tools away and sweep the garage floor, because you are DONE. Oh, yeah. Power up the system to see if you did it right.
    Easy job. By the way, this method works for Fords, too (should you have one laying around).



    12 volts, but looks all original

    Okay, this one is a little harder, but still pretty easy. Even a Marine can do it. This method assumes you have either the original wiring harness, or you have replaced the original harness with a new 6-volt harness. Is your 6-volt harness adequate to convert to 12 volts? Yes, because the 6-volt system produces twice the amperage of the 12-volt system. So, the 6-volt harness is actually heavier than needed for the 12-volt conversion. With that out of the way:
    Disconnect and remove the 6-volt battery. If you discard it, make sure you do so properly. Used Lead acid batteries are hazardous waste, so please dispose of them properly -- it's the law.
    Remove your 6-volt generator.
    Replace with a 12-volt generator. I got mine from a guy hotrodding a '57. It fit perfectly and looks almost identical to the original 6-volt unit.
    Remove the 6-volt voltage regulator and replace it with a 12-volt one. Again, you can probably use the one that came with the 12-volt generator you found.
    OR, if you want to be anal and maintain strict originality, you can use your 6-volt generator -- just take it to a good electrical shop and have them replace the 6-volt field coils with 12-volt ones. Just don't forget to replace your voltage regulator...
    Replace your 6-volt bulbs (headlights, taillights, parking lights, dash lights, dome lights, etc) with 12-volt bulbs.
    Put a ballast resistor* in the line between the ignition switch and the coil
    Put a voltage reducer* in the power line to each 6-volt accessory switch (radio, heater, etc)
    Put a Standard Ignition* in the line to the gas gauge.
    Install a 12-volt coil
    Install a 12-volt battery that fits your battery tray (duh).
    Power up the system and check it out.


    12 volts, but with an alternator

    This one isn't quite so easy. I tried this the first time around and it took a few tries to get it right. At any rate, this approach is pretty widely used and has a lot of advantages, but you lose originality -- you have a big, ugly alternator sticking out like a sore thumb. Yuck. If you can live with that, here's what you do:
    Disconnect and remove the 6-volt battery. If you discard it, make sure you do so properly. Used Lead acid batteries are hazardous waste, so please dispose of them properly -- it's the law.
    Remove your 6-volt generator, coil and voltage regulator.
    Install the alternator. You'll probably have to do some bracket modifications.
    Use a DA plug on your alternator (because most modern alternators have built in regulators, this eliminates the voltage regulator on the firewall)
    Take the "Batt" wire that used to go to the regulator and connect it to the red wire of the DA plug.
    Connect the white wire from the DA plug and connect it to an "ignition" spot, either the ignition switch or the coil wire.
    Wrap up the "field" and "arm" wires that used to connect to the regulator because you don't need them anymore.
    Replace your 6-volt bulbs (headlights, taillights, parking lights, dash lights, dome lights, etc) with 12-volt bulbs.
    Put a ballast resistor* in the line between the ignition switch and the coil
    Put a voltage reducer* in the power line to each 6-volt accessory switch (radio, heater, etc)
    Put a Standard Ignition* in the line to the gas gauge.
    Install a 12-volt coil
    Install a 12-volt battery that fits your battery tray (duh).
    Power up the system and check it out.
    ������*  Check with your parts dealer for the correct part numbers for these items. I went back and checked my records and I actually bought my voltage reducers from Jim Carter's Antique Truck Parts, 1508 East Alton, Independence MO (816) 833-1913. Specifically, they were:
    Part# EL110 Voltage reducer (Light duty for gas gauge)
    Part# EL135 Voltage reducer (Heavy duty for accessories)
    Part# EL181 Voltage reducer (for ignition points)
    The part numbers may have changed since 1995 when I bought mine.

    Alternator Installation

    One low-buck way to install an alternator on a stovebolt six is to use All-Thread, six nuts, & six lockwashers. Using the original generator bracket, cut the All-Thread to size so that the length is a little longer than the bracket. Use a nut and washer on either side of outer bracket; a nut and washer on each side of the alternator; and a nut and washer on each side of the inner bracket. Using All-Thread also allows you to adjust the alternator to line up with the harmonic balancer and the water pump pulleys. It also acts like a shaft on which the alternator can rotate to be adjusted to tension the fan belt. Make sure that the All-Thread, nuts, and washers are the same size as the alternator and generator bracket holes. If you would like a ready made alternator adapter one can be ordered from the fine folks at Buffalo Enterprises.
