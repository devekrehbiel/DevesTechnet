            This Hitch system honors your under-bed spare tire carrier and augments it in that it makes it more solid. Making a hitch system that uses the
            stock bumper and stock spare tire carrier has been a real problem in the past. By starting from scratch, we have been able to create a very solid
            hitch that uses the frame rails and the stock bumper bracket system to make the most solid hitch system available. The really cool thing about
            what we do here is that WE are Advance Design Pickup enthusiasts and we work to provide solutions for you!<br />
