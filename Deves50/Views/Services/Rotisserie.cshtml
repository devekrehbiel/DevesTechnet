    As with all of the content on this website, you can simply click on any picture to get its largest size. In this way,
    we can maintain the clearest definition to make it easier for you to see the detail. If the picture is so big you can't
    see all of it on your screen, all you have to do is hold down CONTROL and move the mouse wheel up and down to resize!

            This project turned out to be one of the most useful tools for a full frame-up restoration. Not only is it useful for frame repairs, but it is
            the perfect thing for sandblasting, prepping and painting. This is something that breaks down when not in use so it doesn't need huge amounts of
            real estate to store. This is relatively easy to make if you start off with two Torin brand (Northern Tool) engine stands. The angled mast needs
            to be made straight, with a inner sleeve for raising and lowering. A 1 inch ACME screw mechanism is created for using your air impact gun for raising
            and lowering.<br /><br />

            The build instruction contains everything you need. We encourage you to build it yourself, however, if you can't do it, email deve@speedprint.com and
            we will get this built for you. If you have any questions or concerns, we are here to help. Either email Deve, or go to forums.devestechnet.com and join
            in on the conversation. Over-sized shipping costs would definitely apply.<br />
