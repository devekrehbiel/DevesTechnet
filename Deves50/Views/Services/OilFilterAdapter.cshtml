            This adapter works flawlessly with the stock exhaust system on any vehicle. This one clamps on the frame rail just front of the
            steering gearbox and is perfect for vehicles without the three bolt mounting pattern on each side.

            This adapter works flawlessly with the stock exhaust system on a 1952-1962 engines with the three bolt mounting pattern on each side. If you
            have headers, measure first to ensure you have the space available. We even have a solution for that!

            This adapter works with the Fenton dual exhaust or with a stock system using an Alternator. You need to use the alternator because of the available
            space. Special thanks to Grigg and Cosmo for the idea!

            Kits are now available! We let you choose the adapter (above) of your choice, then we add stainless braided pressure hose and all of the necessary fittings.
            The 4" Pipe and Tee are to get around your exhaust efficiently. It even comes with oil pressure gauge hookup! All pipe, tee and adapters are stainless steel with
            the exception of the AN fittings which are black anodized aluminum.
