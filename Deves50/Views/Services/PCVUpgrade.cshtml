    There are two kits available, a Regular Kit and a Deluxe Kit (shown on left). The Regular Kit comes complete with all parts necessary to connect your system to the intake
    manifold and to the PCV Valve using 4 feet of 3/8" rubber hose (included). The Valve and everything you need is in the kit. Specify the NPT size of the intake manifold
    when ordering. There were three sizes GM made. They were 1/8" NPT, 3/8" NPT and 1/2" NPT. Since NPT is so different, measure the diameter and you should get
    .405 inches for 1/8" NPT, .675 for 3/8" NPT and .840 for 1/2" NPT. Whichever one is close is the one you need. The regular kit uses barb fittings.
    <b>Price: $74.50 plus $12.50 Postal Priority Shipping</b>
</p>
<p>
    The Deluxe Kit is made specially for your engine and comes with a 3/8" stainless steel hard line. Specify NPT size and engine size for this one. Since all
    kits we make are custom order, we will be in contact if we need more information. <b>Price: $112.50 + oversize shipping.</b>
</p>
<div class="HowToTitle4">Ordering Your Custom PCV Kit.</div>
<p>
    These kits are made to order because there are a few different styles of Intake Manifolds involved. To ensure you get the correct one for your vehicle, please
    look over the pictures and order accordingly.

    Shipping the Deluxe kit is based on distance and must me computed by order. This has to do with oversize shipping rates and the special care taken to get
    the custom stainless to you in good shape. If you are ordering the Deluxe Kit, please send an email to <a href="mailto:deve@speedprint.com?subject=Your Website">deve@speedprint.com</a> so we can adjust the price accordingly.
    Also, please send an email when ordering to let us know what size your intake manifold takes for the fittings as described above.

            This is a really elegant way of eliminating that Road Tube that drips oil all over your precious concrete. The PCV system was first introduced just after
            our vintage vehicles so the upgrade just makes sense. PCV has been a mainstay in all vehicles from 1962 to present. This upgrade gives you the very same
            advantages as modern vehicles. Gases are pulled out of the bottom of the engine where they accumulate causing dirt, corrosion, and contaminants where they
            can do the most damage, filtered and pulled back into the intake manifold and recycled. This system is easy to install and very inexpensive. This has been
            a very popular upgrade because it works, it's easy to install, and increases engine longevity.<br />
