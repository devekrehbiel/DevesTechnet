    As with all of the content on this website, you can simply click on any picture to get its largest size. In this way,
    we can maintain the clearest definition to make it easier for you to see the detail. If the picture is so big you can't
    see all of it on your screen, all you have to do is hold down CONTROL and move the mouse wheel up and down to resize!

            This turned out to be another really indispensable shop solution. Most guys when they make an engine stand, incorporate all of the
            gauges, switches, etc directly on the stand. That's practical, but I wanted to be able to move from my engine stand, to a chassis, or
            even a drivable truck. It's like the Crash Cart E.R.'s use to revive people, only this one revives old Chevy Trucks!<br /><br />

            We took this Start Kart project several steps further and added a small gas tank with fuel filter and shutoff, places for two full
            size car batteries, storage for timing lights, compression gauges, chargers, etc. We made the fuel tank height adjustable and made
            a tilting gauge mount for easier viewing. We then made a 20 foot wire bundle protected by 1/2 inch heater hose for connections to 
            the vehicle. Good Stuff Maynard!
