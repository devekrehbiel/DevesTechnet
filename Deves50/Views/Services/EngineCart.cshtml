            This Engine Cart was designed for easy movement of these engines around the shop. It is designed so that if you have a bell housing AND
            transmission on the engine, it still works flawlessly to keep your heavy items mobile. It works by setting the engine on the oil pan rails.
            Nothing is attached, rather it just sits on the rail system. Although very secure and there is no problems in moving it around, be aware that
            it is not bolted down (Safety Note). This system uses very thick (1/8" walls) 1" square tubing to give it very high strength.<br />
