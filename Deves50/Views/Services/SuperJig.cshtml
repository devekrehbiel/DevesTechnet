    see all of it on your screen, all you have to do is hold down CONTROL and move the mouse wheel up and down to resize!

            This jig was created to address the question of how to secure doors, hoods, fenders, front ends, differentials, etc, etc. for repair, sanding, 
            sandblasting, all body prep. If you had an erector set as a kid, then you can relate. Most shops just use fold up tables to do these bulky parts,
            but this jig fixes them solidly so that long board sanding or anything you do will not be a problem. Set this up and it will rival having these
            parts on the actual frame, only in any orientation you wish.<br />
