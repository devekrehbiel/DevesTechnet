            This 11 gauge Stainless Steel piece goes over the opening in the firewall that is designed for the Ranco Heater Control Valve. Not all trucks have a Heater
            Control Valve, so this solution is tapped and two included Stainless #10-32 screws bolt it in place. You can install it from the inside or the outside depending on your
            tastes. Extra polishing may be required.
