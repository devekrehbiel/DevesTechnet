    see all of it on your screen, all you have to do is hold down CONTROL and move the mouse wheel up and down to resize!

            This Roller Stand is pretty unique in that it uses an AB Dick 360 Form Roller from a printing press for its feature part. This form roller is
            hard rubber with bearing inserts on each side. It is the best solution ever for this application. Then, rather than using a wood base, we use 2"
            square tubing with 5/32" walls with a 1.5 inch inside telescoping feature for raising and lowering. To keep things tight at your chosen height,
            2 1/2" fine thread hold-down bolts cinch down to hold everything solidly in place.<br />
