    As with all of the content on this website, you can simply click on any picture to get its largest size. In this way,
    we can maintain the clearest definition to make it easier for you to see the detail. If the picture is so big you can't
    see all of it on your screen, all you have to do is hold down CONTROL and move the mouse wheel up and down to resize!

            Accessories is sort of our catch-all. The Super Jig has many accessories that are available. From wheel painting spinners that allow you to spin
            your wheels while painting on the SuperJig to extra turnbuckles for your welding table, or just about anything you see on our website, we are always
            happy to share with our fellow restorers.<br />
