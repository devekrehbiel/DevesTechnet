    As with all of the content on this website, you can simply click on any picture to get its largest size. In this way,
    we can maintain the clearest definition to make it easier for you to see the detail. If the picture is so big you can't
    see all of it on your screen, all you have to do is hold down CONTROL and move the mouse wheel up and down to resize!

            This is yet another GIANT breakthrough for us Vintage Vehicle Enthusiasts! This system monitors your most critical systems on your vintage vehicle in
            a similar way your modern vehicles take for granted. This system is a proper Redundant backup system for your gauges providing you with bright LED lights
            that alert you of a catastrophic failure as well as provide you with an Audible Alarm for the most important systems. Rather than scanning your gauges
            and hoping you catch the failure in time, let the vehicle tell YOU when it needs urgent attention!
