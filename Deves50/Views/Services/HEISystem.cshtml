            This is a GIANT breakthrough for us old Stovebolt enthusiasts! Until now, you had to get a modified distributor out of a V6 or somewhere else
            and then the look was unnatural. Use your STOCK distributor, modify it without making any permanent changes to it. If you don't like it, go back
            to your stock points system without any problems. This system is designed so that it looks stock but provides a much hotter and more precise
            spark for better burns of modern fuel mixtures. Amazing too is the fact that this is the most popular upgrade we offer! Read the Install Document
            get a good idea of what is involved in kit installation.
