            This adapter allows you to use your vintage air filter cannister on a newer style carb that mounts differently. For example, the Pre-1955 Carbs
            had a smooth top area and the air filter had a circular clamp that held it on the outside. The newer Carbs have a bridge across the throat with
            a threaded post/wingnut arrangement. This mounts to the top of the newer style Carb to allow for using pre-1955 Air Filter Cannisters.<br />
